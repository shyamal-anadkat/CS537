:: linux :: 
- I have tried to handle all possible invalid inputs/errors with -1 exit status/EXIT_FAILURE.
- It was really important to use valgrind in order to analyze memory leaks in my program due to strdup() and mallocs. 
  The tool helped me to free huge chunks of memory in order to prevent leaks. 
- I wrote a function that reads a file and determines the number of lines in one pass. This helps to alloc memory for storing the unsorted input. 

:: xv6 ::
- getforkcount works as intended and prints out number of forks since boot up in stdout. 
- one thing that I struggled with was making sense of each and every piece of code in xv6.
